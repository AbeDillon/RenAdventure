I love when people don't believe in me. It makes me want to work that much harder to prove them wrong.
Ever since I met you no one else has even been worth thinking about.

No calls, no texts, nothing. But here I am thinking about you like crazy.
Even if you're on the right path, you'll get ran over if you just sit there.
Grudges are a waste of perfect happiness. Laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and let go of what you can't change.
Just sitting around with you and doing nothing, means everything.
Be careful who you trust.
If you walk away and they dont follow you, keep walking.
Love isn't suppose to be easy, it is supposed to be worth it.
The little things mean the most.

There are 2 types of pain in this world: Pain that hurts you, and pain that changes you.
I kinda wanna be more than just friends.
Don't settle for second best, you deserve the best.
Life is too short, so laugh when you can, apologize when you should and let go of what you can't change.
Don't worry about me or what I do. This is my life, not yours.

If you are not willing to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.

My smile hides so fucking much.
If you got a problem with me.. tell me, not everyone else.
If you don't care then stop talking about it.
There are two ways you can get through pain. You can let it destroy you, or you can use it as fuel to drive you.

Unless you've lived my life, you can't judge me.
I don't miss you, I miss the person I thought you were.
The worst feeling in the world is knowing you did the best you could and it still wasn't good enough.
If it hurts, that means you still care.
Nothing lasts forever. So live it up, drink it down, laugh it out, avoid the bullshit, take chances, and never have regrets.
Being faithful shouldn't be hard if you really care about them ..
I want someone who cares about my feelings.
Before we ask God for what we WANT.. we need to thank Him for what we HAVE.

No matter how serious life gets, you still have to have that one person you can be completely stupid with.
Sometimes the person you'd take a bullet for is the person behind the trigger.
Confidence is the key. If you don't believe in yourself, then nobody will.

Knowing others is wisdom, knowing yourself is enlightenment.
Sometimes you have to step back &amp; see what you're becoming.

Don't complain about what you're not willing to change.
To keep a relationship, you must keep your business to yourself and your partner, the whole world doesn't need to know your problems.
To understand the heart and mind of a person, look not at what he has already achieved, but at what he aspires to.
The people who talk the most shit about you, also pays you the most attention.
Confidence is one of the most attractive qualities someone can have.
You can't be friends with everybody.
If you think it's hard being who "you" are, it's a whole lot harder trying to be someone you're not.
Feeling like an idiot when people scream your name and you can't find them.

Life is all about making choices that you can live with. Love is all about making choices you can't live without.
Bestfriends can see the difference between your fake smile and the real one.

Lets put the past behind us &amp; go far away where nobody can find us.
I go to bed thinking about you, wake up thinking about you ... And the fucked up thing is, I'm probably never on your mind.
I fell in love with your personality, your looks are just a bonus.
Wake up determined. Go to bed satisfied.
Every heartache shows us a strength we never knew we had.
How do you become important to someone? Because apparently what I'm doing is not working.
Let the past stay the past.
Develop an appreciation for the present moment. Seize every second of your life and savor it!

A relationship has fights, trust, faith, tears, pain, arguments, secrets, jealousy &amp; love.
Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.
First you care. Then you get hurt.
I hate acting like I don't care when it's really tearing me up inside.
Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.
If I'm with you, I'm with you. Nobody else matters.

We all have scars, we all have stories.
The smaller your circle is, the better.
