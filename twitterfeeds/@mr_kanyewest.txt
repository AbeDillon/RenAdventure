To keep a relationship, you must keep your business to yourself and your partner, the whole world doesn't need to know your problems.
To understand the heart and mind of a person, look not at what he has already achieved, but at what he aspires to.
The people who talk the most shit about you, also pays you the most attention.
Confidence is one of the most attractive qualities someone can have.
You can't be friends with everybody.
If you think it's hard being who "you" are, it's a whole lot harder trying to be someone you're not.
Feeling like an idiot when people scream your name and you can't find them.

Life is all about making choices that you can live with. Love is all about making choices you can't live without.
Bestfriends can see the difference between your fake smile and the real one.
Every path has its puddles.
Beauty is NOTHING without Brains.
Don't follow in someone else's footsteps, use them as your inspiration to create your own path.
Missing someone is a part of loving them. If you're never apart, you'll never really know how strong your love is.
Sometimes you forgive people simply because you still want them in your life.
When someone does something wrong, don't forget all the things they did right.

Lets put the past behind us &amp; go far away where nobody can find us.
I go to bed thinking about you, wake up thinking about you ... And the fucked up thing is, I'm probably never on your mind.
I fell in love with your personality, your looks are just a bonus.
Wake up determined. Go to bed satisfied.
Every heartache shows us a strength we never knew we had.
How do you become important to someone? Because apparently what I'm doing is not working.
Let the past stay the past.
Develop an appreciation for the present moment. Seize every second of your life and savor it!

A relationship has fights, trust, faith, tears, pain, arguments, secrets, jealousy &amp; love.
Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.
First you care. Then you get hurt.
I hate acting like I don't care when it's really tearing me up inside.
Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.
If I'm with you, I'm with you. Nobody else matters.

Not everything is meant to last forever, so enjoy shit when it happens...
I can't lose you. Because if I ever did, I'd have lost my best friend, my soul mate, my smile, my laugh, my everything.     - The Vow"
Be happy with what you have while working for what you want.
Hey you....yeah you ....Keep your head up. God gives his hardest battles to his strongest soldiers.
These days it seems like the only person you can truly trust is yourself.
If it's meant to be, it will be.
Dear #oomf,   I  W A N T  Y O U  AND ONLY YOU  ‚ù§üòçüòòüòáüëçüíï
These days, it's hard to find someone you can actually trust.
We all have scars, we all have stories.
The smaller your circle is, the better.

The saddest thing in life is when you meet that special someone and you know it will never be, and sooner or later you'll have to let go.
Every good friend was once a stranger.
Where were you when I needed you?
The first to apologize is the bravest. The first to forgive is the strongest. The first to move forward is the happiest.
As crazy as it may sound, people love you more when you don't give a damn.
The smallest acts of kindness, make the biggest differences in someone's life.
I think I need glasses. Because everywhere I look, people have two faces.
One day, someone will walk into your life and you'll see why it never worked out with anyone else.

To live means to love. To love means to suffer. If you don't want to suffer,don't love. But if you don't love, then what are you living for?
Sometimes you keep your feelings to yourself because it's hard for someone else to ever really understand...
R-E-T-W-E-E-T if you woke up with someone on your mind.
Hurting someone with the truth is better than making them happy with a lie.
I respect those that tell me the truth, no matter how hard it is.
There are only two options regarding commitment: you're either in or you're out. There's no such thing as life in between.
I've liked you since I met you.
I still like you, I'm just tired of trying.
It's my life, and I'm gonna live it how I want.
Forgive yourself for your faults and your mistakes and move on.
One day you'll realize I'm the one who's always been there for you.
Sometimes, giving someone a second chance is like giving someone an extra bullet because they missed you the first time.
There's a difference between who we love, who we settle for, and who we're meant for.
We have to constantly make adjustments in life if we want to be successful, because life will never adjust to fit our needs.
I think it's cute when somebody straight up tells you that they like you.
Receiving mixed signals means you're not the only option.
OMG!!! Only go to this college if you like to PARTY EVERYDAY ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://t.co/GckjOX5rrl
When I'm with you, hours feel like seconds. When we're apart, days feel like years.
Best relationship? When you can act like lovers and bestfriends at the same time...
The worst feeling is when someone makes you feel special, then suddenly leaves you hanging, and you have to act like you don't care at all.
Tough situations build strong people.
You're not ready for the next, if you're still replying to your ex.
To achieve success, you have to know what failure feels like. Learn from your mistakes and make the steps to improve.
Never lie to someone that trusts you. Never trust someone that lied to you.
As long as you've got passion, faith and are willing to work hard, you can do anything you want in this life.
LMAOOOO! Kobe Bryant crying like a BITCH ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://t.co/fXyUFauZLB
When she tells you her secrets, it doesn't mean she's complaining about shit, it means she trusts you.
Don't let them get too close too quick.
Just because you know my name... Doesn't mean you know me.
I like being alone, listening to music in my own world, away from all the bullshit in life...
Life doesn't get easier, you just get stronger.
